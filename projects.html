            <p>Tower of Hanoi is a logic game where you must move a series of disks between three towers. You are only allowed to move one disk at a time and a larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk. The game ends when all the disks are on the third tower.</p>
            <p>The game was built with mostly vanilla JavaScript. There was some jQuery used to make sure some of the aspects were written cleaner. While building some of the actions, I ran into an issue where the multiple event listeners were interfering with each other. I was able to remedy this by creating just one listener that was used by all the clicks for the towers. This is the part of the project that I feel really proved my mettle.

            <p>Community Kitchen is a place where anyone can gather and share their favorite recipes. They can also keep track of their favorite recipes that someone else had shared with the community. This is a full stack application built using MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, and Node.js.</p>
            <p>Chefs can add, edit, and remove their recipes. I encountered some issues in regard to displaying ingredients as chefs were putting them in. Since I wanted to display the ingredients in their own line. To resolve this, I put in the input for a chef to enter a single ingredient per line. From there I was able to use a string split at the line break to split the ingredients.
